<p>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>



<p>I am a rising junior at Los Gatos High School. I am involved in Yearbook, and currently hold the title as Editor. I enjoy all outdoor activities, including; boating, skiing, swimming, hiking, golfing and traveling. I love to write, design layouts, take pictures and spend time with my family. I am an organized, kind, helpful, passionate person. I am involved in many non-profit organizations, and enjoy giving my time on a weekly basis. I complete 100+ hours/year. I am also a technology guru. I love exploring new technology... and am quite good at it. As a detail-oriented person, I am currently working on more design projects, I enjoy graphic and interior design-- plus I have a great eye for colors and position. I live with my dad, mom, ll year-old sister Natalie and 2 orange tabbies, Oliver and Tigger. As a 16 year-old, I love to hangout with my friends, and have fun. I am currently interested i coding -- as itâ€™s the now and the future. I enjoy using code, and have worked and produced many projects with the support of the Microsoft staff.

Thanks,

Hannah Lane</p>
